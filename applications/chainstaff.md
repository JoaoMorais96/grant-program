- Transparent Recruiting: Chainstaff connects companies with professionals, facilitating job recruitment through a user's network. This system is designed to be more transparent and effective than traditional job posting platforms and headhunter services.
- Cost-Effective Solutions: It addresses the high costs associated with traditional recruitment methods, such as platform fees or headhunter charges, by offering a more affordable and scalable solution.

### Platform Mechanics

- Two-Sided Platform: Chainstaff serves a dual-purpose audience. On one side, there are companies
  (Demand-Side) looking to fill positions. On the other side, there are users (Seller-Side) who have networks potentially containing suitable candidates.

### Process Flow

1. Companies post job offerings for free, with a reward for successful referrals.
2. Users search for and refer potential candidates from their network.
3. When a match is successful, the referring user receives a portion of the reward, while Chainstaff also benefits from the transaction.

### User Benefits

- Discover: Users can explore a dynamic job marketplace on Chainstaff, identifying potential career
  opportunities that might be suitable for people in their network.
- Share: The platform enables users to share open job positions with their contacts, such as colleagues,
  friends, or connections. This not only assists others in finding suitable jobs but also helps in their job
  search.
- Earn: When a professional from a user's network secures a job through the platform, the user who
  shared the job opportunity receives rewards. This creates a mutually beneficial situation where both
  the referrer and the job seeker gain financially.
  More information about Chainstaff can be found [in their website](https://www.chainstaff.info/)

### Technical Setup

- User-Centric Design: The platform is built with a strong focus on the end-user experience. It includes an app that allows users to refer people directly to job openings. This app is platform-independent, catering to both iOS and Android users using Flutter.
- Web-Based Parts: Companies can easily post job offerings and users can upload their CVs through a web interface.
- Smart Contract Functionality: The distribution of payments and rewards is managed through smart contracts (a factory contract will create a simple payment distribution contract for each company to fund with their intended budget). Initially, the reward distribution will be static with fixed percentages. Later, the system will evolve to include varying incentives, such as higher success fees for users referring multiple suitable candidates. These analytics will be obtained from our backend and on-chain information for each user and the payment handler contracts will have the option to have a single tier of various tiers (for the two cases described earlier);
- Cryptocurrency Integration: To ensure a smooth customer experience, the use of cryptocurrency is not mandatory. Chainstaff will use stablecoins but will also provide fiat on and off-ramp options for both companies and users.

### Market Engagement

- Partnerships: Chainstaff is in advanced discussions with major Swiss companies, indicating its
  growing presence and acceptance in the professional market.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Innovation and Scalability: Chainstaff introduces a unique, scalable HR solution to the VeChain ecosystem. Its innovative approach in leveraging blockchain technology for recruitment aligns perfectly with VeChain's emphasis on practical blockchain applications.
- User Engagement and Adoption: The platform, accessible through a user-friendly app, is designed to enhance user adoption of VeChain. It appeals to both businesses and individual users, thereby broadening VeChain's user base and driving real-world usage.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0a.    | Documentation                                                                  | We will provide simple documentation for each contract, explaining their main functions nad their roles.                                                                                                                                                                   |

We will describe how to run both the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and Vechain testnet tests.                                                           |
| 3a.    | Smart Contracts: Development                                                   | We will develop smart contracts that will deal with the payment handling                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3b.    | Smart Contracts: Testing with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) | We will create several tests in [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). Because it allows us to run a mock up of an EVM compatible blockchain and simulate the passage of time, we can run several tests in a matter of seconds, making it easier for debugging. |
| 3c.    | Smart Contracts: Testing with Vechain Testnet                                  | We will replicate all the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tests but with regular Python scripts, using the thor-requests library and the testnet. This way we can make sure there is no functionality loss between blockchains.                           |

## Future Plans

### Company Background and Initial Focus:

- Expertise: The founder brings over a decade of Human Resource experience and has established a

This expansion underscores the company's ambition to have a global presence.

### Technical Evolution:

- Adherence to Latest Standards: Chainstaff is committed to using the latest technological standards.
